# CSSAntique Chrome extension


[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)

This extension adds a panel on Chrome DevTools where you can emulate old browsers CSS support on each visited webpage by disabling the CSS properties not supported by the targeted browser.
It is a wrapper around the [cssantique](https://github.com/mmai/cssantique) / [browser-data](https://github.com/mmai/browser-data) javascript libraries.

The app is on its very early stages, you can play with it but don't rely on it for testing your projects: use the real platforms!
